# Product Context: PeakRush Timer

## Purpose & Problem Statement

PeakRush Timer addresses the need for a specialized interval timer that caters specifically to high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts. Unlike general-purpose timers, PeakRush provides visual and audio cues that help users maintain their workout intensity and stay on track with their exercise plan.

## Key User Problems Solved

1. **Structured Workout Management**:

   - Manual timing of intervals during workouts is distracting and error-prone
   - Maintaining consistent interval lengths without assistance is difficult
   - Keeping track of completed sets mentally takes focus away from the workout

2. **Intensity Transitions**:

   - Sudden transitions between intensity levels can be jarring without proper warning
   - Missed transition cues can throw off an entire workout sequence
   - Visual reinforcement helps maintain proper intensity levels

3. **Background Operation**:
   - Workout apps that stop functioning when the phone is locked interrupt the exercise flow
   - Missing notifications during background mode can cause missed intervals
   - Audio cues need to work reliably even when the app isn't in focus

## User Experience Goals

1. **Simplicity First**:

   - Minimal setup time before starting a workout
   - Clear, at-a-glance status indicators
   - Intuitive controls that don't require explanation

2. **Focused Feedback**:

   - Color-coded visual system (green for low intensity, red for high intensity)
   - Audio warnings before phase changes to prepare mentally
   - Haptic feedback for immediate physical notifications

3. **Reliability**:
   - Consistent operation even when the app is backgrounded
   - Battery-efficient design for extended workout sessions
   - Accurate timing that maintains integrity throughout the workout

## User Journey

1. User configures their workout parameters:

   - Sets the duration of each intensity interval
   - Chooses the number of complete sets to perform
   - Selects whether to start with low or high intensity

2. During the workout:

   - Clear countdown timer shows remaining time in current interval
   - Visual indicators show current intensity level
   - Audio cues signal upcoming transitions
   - Set counter tracks progress through the workout

3. Workout completion:
   - Summary of completed workout
   - Option to restart with same parameters
   - Return to configuration for adjustment

## Value Proposition

PeakRush Timer eliminates the mental overhead of tracking intervals during high-intensity workouts, allowing users to focus entirely on their physical performance. The combination of visual, audio, and haptic feedback creates a comprehensive guidance system that keeps users on track without requiring constant attention to their device.
