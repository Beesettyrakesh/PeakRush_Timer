  - Additional proportional buffer for very short intervals (‚â§10 seconds)
- **Duplicate Prevention**:
  - State tracking with `hasScheduledCompletionNotification`
  - Time-based throttling (10-second window)
  - Scheduled time comparison
  - Proper cleanup during background-foreground transitions

### User Experience

Users receive a congratulatory notification upon workout completion at the right time, without duplicates, even if their device is locked or they're using another app.
