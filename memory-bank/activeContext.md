# Active Context: PeakRush Timer

## Current Focus

We are currently setting up the memory bank for the PeakRush Timer project to document its structure, functionality, and design decisions. This is the initial documentation phase to establish a clear understanding of the application's architecture and codebase.

The PeakRush Timer app is fully implemented and operational. It features a complete HIIT workout timer with:

- Timer configuration (duration, sets, starting intensity)
- Timer execution with visual and audio feedback
- Background execution support with notifications
- Audio warnings for phase transitions

## Recent Updates

- Fixed critical timer jumping bug when switching between apps
- Memory bank initialization (current task)
- Documentation of project structure and architecture
- Analysis of existing code and functionality

## Current Status

The app appears to be in a released state with the following components implemented:

1. **Configuration Screen**:

   - Working UI for setting interval duration (minutes/seconds)
   - Set count selection
   - Starting intensity toggle
   - Total workout duration calculation

2. **Timer Execution Screen**:

   - Functional countdown timer
   - Visual indicators for current intensity (green/red)
   - Set tracking
   - Controls for starting, pausing, and resetting
   - Support for background execution

3. **Additional Features**:
   - Audio warnings before phase transitions
   - Speech announcements for set completion
   - Background notifications
   - Timer adjustment when returning from background

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Memory Bank Documentation**:

   - Finish creating the core memory bank files (progress.md)
   - Review documentation for accuracy and completeness

2. **Potential Enhancements** (to be discussed):

   - User-configurable warning times for transitions
   - Preset configurations for common HIIT workouts
   - Workout history tracking
   - Custom sound options for notifications
   - AppleWatch integration for on-wrist timer control

3. **Potential Technical Improvements** (to be evaluated):
   - Add unit tests for critical timer logic
   - Improve background execution reliability
   - Optimize battery usage during extended workouts
   - Enhance accessibility features

## Outstanding Questions

1. What is the deployment target and current App Store status?
2. Are there known issues or bugs that need to be addressed?
3. What are the current user feedback priorities?
4. Are there feature requests from users that should be considered?
5. What is the roadmap for future versions?

## Current Decisions

1. Setting up comprehensive memory bank documentation to facilitate future development and maintenance
2. Analyzing the current architecture to identify potential improvement areas
3. Examining background execution handling as a key technical focus area
4. Fixed the timer jumping bug by synchronizing timestamp usage in background/foreground transitions
