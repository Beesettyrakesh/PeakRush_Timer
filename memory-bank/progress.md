# PeakRush Timer - Progress Tracking

## 🟢 What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Timer configuration interface (minutes, seconds, sets, intensity selection)
- ✅ Timer execution with visual progress indicators
- ✅ Phase transitions between low and high intensity
- ✅ Set completion tracking and progression
- ✅ Audio cues for phase transitions and set completions
- ✅ Background operation when app is minimized
- ✅ Push notifications for workout completion

### Technical Systems
- ✅ MVVM architecture implementation
- ✅ Background task management
- ✅ Audio session configuration and management
- ✅ Interruption handling for audio playback
- ✅ State preservation across app lifecycle events
- ✅ Dynamic UI updates based on timer state

### Recent Bug Fixes

- ✅ Fixed incorrect set numbers in speech announcements by using current timer state
- ✅ Fixed premature completion notifications with dynamic buffer calculation
- ✅ Fixed timer jumping issue during brief app switches with smart timer preservation
- ✅ Enhanced background warning scheduling system with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Improved duplicate prevention mechanisms with multi-layer protection
- ✅ Fixed audio session management failures during extended background operation
- ✅ Implemented audio session keep-alive mechanism for long workouts
- ✅ Added background task renewal system to extend background execution time
- ✅ Fixed race conditions between speech warnings and notifications
- ✅ Enhanced notification deduplication with content-based tracking
- ✅ Fixed set intensity bug where new sets were not starting with the configured intensity
- ✅ Fixed completion notification timing issue where notifications were sent before final speech warning
- ✅ Added predictive logging for phase/set transitions to improve debugging experience
- ✅ Fixed EXC_BAD_ACCESS errors in unit tests with TestableAudioManager approach
- ✅ Improved UI component testability by simplifying LinearGradient to Color
- ✅ Implemented robust mocking strategy for system framework classes
- ✅ Fixed compiler warnings and errors in AudioManager.swift and TimerRunViewModel.swift

## 📊 Current Status

**Project Phase**: Beta Testing

**Completion Percentage**: ~75%

**Current Focus**: 
1. Comprehensive documentation of background audio system
2. Final stabilization of timer functionality
3. Preparing for database integration

**Recent Milestones**:
- Completed enhanced fix for timer jumping bug
- Implemented multi-layer duplicate prevention for audio cues
- Added detailed documentation for background audio system
- Improved buffer calculation for short intervals

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Timer Accuracy**: While significantly improved, there can still be minor timing discrepancies during very brief app switches.

2. **Battery Usage**: Background operation can consume significant battery power due to the continuous background task and audio session management.

3. **UI Responsiveness**: The state-indicating circular display can occasionally stutter during phase transitions.

4. **Notification Reliability**: Push notifications may not appear if the app is terminated by the system after extended background operation (>45 minutes).

5. **Device Variations**: Some older iOS devices may still experience audio session issues during very long workouts due to hardware limitations.

6. **Audio Playback Failure in Long Workouts**: During extended background operation with longer workouts (12+ sets), the app may fail to play warning sounds for later sets.

7. **Background Task Expiration**: During longer workouts, background tasks may expire despite the renewal system, affecting audio playback and notifications.

8. **Speech Interruption**: Speech synthesis may be interrupted during longer workouts, resulting in incomplete audio cues.

9. **Missing Phase Transition Warning for Set 2**: The phase sequence generation logic is skipping set 2 in the warning schedule.

10. **Inconsistent Warning Playback Timing**: In some cases, warnings are played at unexpected times due to system throttling during extended background operation.

11. **Notification Timing Issue**: In some cases, notifications may still be sent before speech warnings complete, particularly for longer workouts.

12. **Minor Log Issues**: Several minor issues including typos in log messages ("TRNASITION" instead of "TRANSITION"), inconsistent log formatting, and redundant log messages.

## 🔄 Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Initial Approach**: Started with a simpler MVC pattern
- **Current Approach**: Migrated to MVVM for better separation of concerns and testability
- **Rationale**: The complexity of background state management required cleaner separation between UI and business logic

### Background Processing Strategy
- **Initial Approach**: Simple timer invalidation when entering background
- **Intermediate Approach**: Preserve timer for brief background durations (<2 seconds)
- **Current Approach**: Never invalidate timer for background state, use smart timer firing compensation
- **Rationale**: Eliminating timer jumps during quick app switches required preserving the timer state

### Audio System
- **Initial Approach**: Basic sound playback
- **Intermediate Approach**: Background audio scheduling with set-based tracking
- **Current Approach**: Comprehensive audio system with timestamp-based tracking and multi-layer duplicate prevention
- **Rationale**: Needed to ensure reliable audio cues even with multiple background-foreground transitions

### Notification Strategy
- **Initial Approach**: Simple notification scheduling
- **Current Approach**: Dynamic buffer calculation based on interval duration with multiple duplicate prevention mechanisms
- **Rationale**: Short intervals required more sophisticated timing to prevent premature or duplicate notifications

### Documentation Approach
- **Initial Approach**: Basic code comments
- **Current Approach**: Comprehensive documentation with line-by-line explanations of critical functions
- **Rationale**: Complex background processing logic required detailed documentation for future maintenance

### Future Direction
- Planning to implement database storage for workout configurations
- Considering cross-platform development for Android
- Evaluating cloud database options for user data synchronization
