## Current Status

The application is fully implemented and appears ready for use. All core HIIT timer functionality is working, including:

1. **Configuration Flow**: Users can set up their workout parameters
2. **Timer Execution**: The timer runs correctly with appropriate feedback
3. **Background Support**: Timer continues when app is backgrounded
4. **Audio Feedback**: Sound alerts play at appropriate times
5. **Visual Design**: Clean, modern UI with good usability

## Known Issues

Based on code review, the following potential issues might need attention:

1. **Background Execution Time**: iOS limits background execution to approximately 3 minutes, which could affect longer workouts
2. **Audio Session Conflicts**: Potential conflicts with other audio apps when running in the background
3. **Notification Permission**: No explicit handling if user denies notification permissions
4. **Battery Usage**: Extended background execution may cause significant battery drain
5. **Time Drift**: Timer accuracy might decrease during extended background periods

## Next Development Priorities

### Short Term Improvements

1. Add proper unit tests for critical timer logic
2. Improve error handling for audio and notification failures
3. Add settings options for audio preferences
4. Enhance accessibility support

### Medium Term Features

1. Add workout presets for common HIIT patterns
2. Implement workout history tracking
3. Create statistics dashboard
4. Add custom sound options

### Long Term Vision

1. Apple Watch companion app
2. Workout plan creation and sharing
3. Integration with Health app
4. Community features for sharing workouts
