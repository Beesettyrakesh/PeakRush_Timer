# PeakRush Timer - Progress Tracking

## 🟢 What Works

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Timer configuration interface (minutes, seconds, sets, intensity selection)
- ✅ Timer execution with visual progress indicators
- ✅ Phase transitions between low and high intensity
- ✅ Set completion tracking and progression
- ✅ Audio cues for phase transitions and set completions
- ✅ Background operation when app is minimized
- ✅ Push notifications for workout completion

### Technical Systems
- ✅ MVVM architecture implementation
- ✅ Background task management
- ✅ Audio session configuration and management
- ✅ Interruption handling for audio playback
- ✅ State preservation across app lifecycle events
- ✅ Dynamic UI updates based on timer state

### Recent Bug Fixes
- ✅ Fixed duplicate speech warnings in background mode with timestamp-based tracking
- ✅ Fixed incorrect set numbers in speech announcements by using current timer state
- ✅ Fixed premature completion notifications with dynamic buffer calculation
- ✅ Fixed timer jumping issue during brief app switches with smart timer preservation
- ✅ Enhanced background warning scheduling system with comprehensive documentation
- ✅ Improved duplicate prevention mechanisms with multi-layer protection

## 📊 Current Status

**Project Phase**: Beta Testing

**Completion Percentage**: ~75%

**Current Focus**: 
1. Comprehensive documentation of background audio system
2. Final stabilization of timer functionality
3. Preparing for database integration

**Recent Milestones**:
- Completed enhanced fix for timer jumping bug
- Implemented multi-layer duplicate prevention for audio cues
- Added detailed documentation for background audio system
- Improved buffer calculation for short intervals

## ⚠️ Known Issues

1. **Timer Accuracy**: While significantly improved, there can still be minor timing discrepancies during very brief app switches.

2. **Audio Playback**: On some devices, audio warnings may not play consistently when the app has been in the background for extended periods (>30 minutes).

3. **Battery Usage**: Background operation can consume significant battery power due to the continuous background task.

4. **UI Responsiveness**: The state-indicating circular display can occasionally stutter during phase transitions.

5. **Notification Reliability**: Push notifications may not appear if the app is terminated by the system while in background.

## 🔄 Evolution of Project Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Initial Approach**: Started with a simpler MVC pattern
- **Current Approach**: Migrated to MVVM for better separation of concerns and testability
- **Rationale**: The complexity of background state management required cleaner separation between UI and business logic

### Background Processing Strategy
- **Initial Approach**: Simple timer invalidation when entering background
- **Intermediate Approach**: Preserve timer for brief background durations (<2 seconds)
- **Current Approach**: Never invalidate timer for background state, use smart timer firing compensation
- **Rationale**: Eliminating timer jumps during quick app switches required preserving the timer state

### Audio System
- **Initial Approach**: Basic sound playback
- **Intermediate Approach**: Background audio scheduling with set-based tracking
- **Current Approach**: Comprehensive audio system with timestamp-based tracking and multi-layer duplicate prevention
- **Rationale**: Needed to ensure reliable audio cues even with multiple background-foreground transitions

### Notification Strategy
- **Initial Approach**: Simple notification scheduling
- **Current Approach**: Dynamic buffer calculation based on interval duration with multiple duplicate prevention mechanisms
- **Rationale**: Short intervals required more sophisticated timing to prevent premature or duplicate notifications

### Documentation Approach
- **Initial Approach**: Basic code comments
- **Current Approach**: Comprehensive documentation with line-by-line explanations of critical functions
- **Rationale**: Complex background processing logic required detailed documentation for future maintenance

### Future Direction
- Planning to implement database storage for workout configurations
- Considering cross-platform development for Android
- Evaluating cloud database options for user data synchronization
